## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Because I am new to web development, I had to learn a little bit of everything (HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails MVC architecture and Bootstrap). It was really time consuming to find the information I needed when I was stuck on an issue. I think the language syntax was the most frustrating part for me.
